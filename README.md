$ roslaunch capsicum_superellipsoid_detector start.launch
```







## Meetings

### 15-July-2021

- Surface normal extraction and predicting mass center using Least Squares IntersectÄ±on of Lines is working, results look promising.
- Code is implemented in C++ mainly, prototype can be found in `notebooks/intersection_of_lines.ipynb`

ToDo:

- Seperated ROI pointclouds will be mapped with a higher precision Octomap and the algorithm will be tested on it.
- Evaluation is needed. Firstly try with default ground truths, after getting better results increase the resolution. If the orientation of the pepper is needed figure out a way.
- Implement superellipsoid optimizer using a non-linear least-squares library (e.g. ceres-solver, Eigen)

### 8-July-2021

(may not be complete because this documentation is started on 15 July)

- Superellipsoid optimization is implemented in Python. Prototype can be found in ` notebooks/detector.ipynb`

ToDo:

- Optimization gets stuck in local solutions (can be seen in the screenshot, the pepper on the upper right). Needs a prediction of the center for peppers.
- Use raw pointcloud from sensor.
